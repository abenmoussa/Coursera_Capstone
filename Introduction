Introduction :

Paris “The City of Light” is the capital and the most populous city of France. 
Paris is known for its magic, charm and beauty. It has a dense culture and a diverse range of people.
The city has also one of the best employment opportunities in Europe.
This is what makes it so attractive for people seeking for jobs and cultural life.
Its estimated population, in 2020, is 2,150,271 residents, in an area of 105 square kilometres (41 square miles), which is considered as high density.
The City of Paris is the centre and seat of government of the île de France, 
which has an estimated official 2020 population of 12,278,210, or about 18 percent of the population of France.
Paris was the second most expensive city in the world, after Singapore in 2018.
So, it is difficult for families wanting to settle in Paris or in its surroundings to find a house where the housing prices are low and the essential venues are nearby.
The aim of my project, using the data available online and applying the data science principles, is to help families find a good balance between price and a good place to live in Paris and its metropolis (Greater Paris).
