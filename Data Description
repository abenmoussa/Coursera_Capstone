Data Description:

In order to achieve my goal, i will use Foursquare to get geolocation data of Paris and its surroundings. I will also use the website https://www.data.gouv.fr/
which contains dataset that i need to:

Get the list of the communes of the Ile de France and their GPS coordinates (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/d824bbb3-37d6-4b47-bd69-d7851badb347).
Get the housing prices per m2 (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/36bb13d0-6cac-4540-b8b9-67c2162661ba).

As my analysis will concern only communes of Greater Paris, i will get this list from an other source (http://comersis.fr/communes.php?epci=200054781)

The first step consists of collecting and working on these 3 datasets, so i will have the list of the communities of Greater Paris with their GPS coordinates and the average prices.
The second step of collecting data will be searching for venues from Foursquare in each commune. 
The venues, that i will keep, will be the most important for a family which essantilly are looking for near transport, elementary school, parks, pharmacy, bakery...
