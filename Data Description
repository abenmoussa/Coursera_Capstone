Data Description:

In order to achieve my goal, i will use Foursquare to get geolocation data of Paris and its surroundings. I will also use the website https://www.data.gouv.fr/
which contains dataset that i need to:

Get the list of the communes of the greater Paris and their GPS coordinates (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/d824bbb3-37d6-4b47-bd69-d7851badb347).
Get the housing prices per m2 (https://www.data.gouv.fr/fr/datasets/r/36bb13d0-6cac-4540-b8b9-67c2162661ba).
